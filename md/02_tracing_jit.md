# Background: Assumptions of Tracing JIT Compiler

--
## Assumptions

- programs spend most of their runtime in loops

- everal iterations of the same loop are likely to take similar code paths

---
# Internal Techniques: Tracing JIT Compiler

Tracing JIT techniques is built on above assumptions.

--

## Phases
- Interpretation / Profiling
- Tracing
- Compilation
- Running

--

## Devises

- Guards
- Position key

---
# Phases: Interpretation / Profiling

- when the program starts, everything is interpreted

--
-  do profiling

  - counts how often the *backwark jump** is executed

  - too many jumps → .red[Hot Loop]

.footnote[.red.bold[*] jump to the previous instruction]

---
# Phases: Tracing

## Conditions for Entering

- when .red[Hot Loop] is identified

--

## Subject doing tracing

- Tracer

--

## During

- records a history of all the executed oprations*

.footnote[.red.bold[*] name: Trace]

---
class: middle, center, inverse

# [Code Example for the Trace](./trace.html)

---

# Phases: Compilation (code generation)

generate efficient machine code using a trace

---

# Phases: Running (code execution)

execute machine codes made at compilation phases

---

# Devices: Gurad

## Role

--

- ensure correctness in progress

- a guard failing, *fall back to* **interpretation phase**

--

## Usecase

- places guard at every possible point where the path could go another direction

---

# Devices: Position Key

## Role

--

- recognizes the corresponding loop for a trace

- describes the position of the execution of the program

  - have executed functions and program counter

--

## Usecase
- check position key at backward branch instruction*

.footnote[.red.bold[*] to check the loop is closed]
